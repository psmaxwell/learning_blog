or malignant.
As such, Machine learning can play a key role in determining a person’s health and welfare.
You’ll also learn about the value of decision trees and how building a good decision tree
from historical data helps doctors to prescribe the proper medicine for each of their patients.
You’ll learn how bankers use machine learning to make decisions on whether to approve loan
applications.
And you will learn how to use machine learning to do bank customer segmentation, where it

#### Intro to Machine Learning
Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” First, how do you think Netflix and Amazon recommend videos, movies, and TV shows to its users? They **use Machine Learning to produce suggestions that you might enjoy!** This is similar to how your friends might recommend a television show to you, based on their knowledge of the types of shows you like to watch. How do you think banks make a decision when approving a loan application? They **use machine learning to predict the probability of default for each applicant, and then approve or refuse the loan application based on that probability.** **Telecommunication companies use their customers’ demographic data to segment them, or predict if they will unsubscribe from their company the next month.**There are many other applications of machine learning that we see every day in our daily life, such as chatbots, logging into our phones or even computer games using face recognition Each of these use different machine learning techniques and algorithms.So, let’s quickly examine a few of the more popular techniques.**The Regression/Estimation technique is used for predicting a continuous value**, for example,predicting things like the price of a house based on its characteristics, or to estimate the Co2 emission from a car’s engine. **A Classification technique is used for Predicting the class or category of a case,** for example,if a cell is benign or malignant, or whether or not a customer will churn. **Clustering groups of similar cases**, for example, can find similar patients, or can be used for customer segmentation in the banking field.**Association technique is used for finding items or events that often co-occur**, for example,grocery items that are usually bought together by a particular customer.**Anomaly detection is used to discover abnormal and unusual cases**, for example, it is used for credit card fraud detection.**Sequence mining is used for predicting the next event**, for instance, the click-stream in websites.Dimension reduction is used to reduce the size of data.And finally, recommendation systems; this associates people's preferences with others who have similar tastes, and recommends new items to them, such as books or movies.We will cover some of these techniques in the next videos.By this point, I’m quite sure this question has crossed your mind, “What is the differencebetween these buzzwords that we keep hearing these days, such as Artificial intelligence(or AI), Machine Learning and Deep Learning?”Well, let me explain what is different between them.In brief, **AI tries to make computers intelligent in order to mimic the cognitive functions of humans**.So, **Artificial Intelligence is a general field with a broad scope including: Computer Vision,Language Processing, Creativity, and Summarization.Machine Learning is the branch of AI that covers the statistical part of artificial intelligence**.It teaches the computer to solve problems by looking at hundreds or thousands of examples,learning from them, and then using that experience to solve the same problem in new situations.And **Deep Learning is a very special field of Machine Learning where computers can actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own.Deep learning involves a deeper level of automation in comparison with most machine learning algorithms.**Now that we’ve completed the introduction to Machine Learning, subsequent videos will focus on reviewing two main components: First, you’ll be learning about the purposeof Machine Learning and where it can be applied in the real world; and Second, you’ll get a general overview of Machine Learning topics, such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, model evaluation and various Machine Learning algorithms.So now that you have a sense with what’s in store on this journey, let’s continue our exploration of Machine Learning!

#### Python for Machine Learning
we’ll talk about **how to use python for machine learning**.**Python is a popular and powerful general-purpose programming language that recently emerged as the preferred language among data scientists**.You can write your machine learning algorithm using python, and it works very well. However, **there are a lot of modules and libraries already implemented in python that can make your life much easier**.We try to introduce the Python packages in this course and use it in the labs to give you better hands-on experience.The first package is **Numpy, which is a math library to work with n-dimensional arrays in Python.It enables you to do computation efficiently and effectively.It is better than regular python because of it’s amazing capabilities.**For example, **for working with arrays, dictionaries, functions, datatypes, and working with images,you need to know Numpy**.**SciPy is a collection of numerical algorithms and domain-specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more.SciPy is a good library for scientific and high-performance computation**.**Matplotlib is a very popular plotting package that provides 2D plotting as well as 3D plotting**.Basic Knowledge about these 3 packages, which are built on top of python, is a good asset for data scientists who want to work with real world problems.If you are not familiar with these packages, I recommend that you take the “Data Analysis with Python” course first.This course covers most of the useful topics in these packages.**Pandas library, is a very high-level python library that provides high-performance, easy to use data structures.It has many functions for data importing, manipulation and analysis.In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series**.**scikit-learn is a collection of algorithms and tools for machine learning**, which is our focus here, and which you’ll learn to use with in this course.As we’ll be using scikit-learn quite a bit, in the labs, let me explain more about it and show you why it is so popular among data scientists.**Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library for the Python programming language.It has most of the classification, regression and clustering algorithms, and it’s designed to work with the Python numerical and scientific libraries, NumPy and SciPy.Also, it includes very good documentation**.On top of that, implementing machine learning models with scikit learn is really easy, with a few lines of python code.**Most of the tasks that need to be done in a machine learning pipeline are implemented already in scikit learn, including, pre-processing of data, feature selection, feature extraction,train/test splitting, defining the algorithms, fitting models, tuning parameters, prediction,evaluation, and exporting the model.Let me show you an example of how scikit learn looks like when you use this library**.You don’t have to understand the code for now, but just see how easily you can build a model with just a few lines of code.Basically, Machine learning algorithms benefit from standardization of the data set.If there are some outliers, or different scales fields in your data set, you have to fix them.The preprocessing package of scikit learn provides several **common utility functions and transformer classes to change raw feature vectors into a suitable form of vector for modeling**.You have to split your dataset into train and test sets to train your model, and then test the model’s accuracy separately.**Scikit learn can split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets for you,in one line of code**.Then, you can setup your algorithm.For example, you can build a classifier using a support vector classification algorithm.We call our estimator instance clf, and initialize its parameters.Now, you can train your model with the train set.By passing our training set to the fit method, the clf model learns to classify unknown cases.Then, we can use our test set to run predictions.And, the result tells us what the class of each unknown value is.Also, you can use different metrics to evaluate your model accuracy, for example, using a confusion matrix to show the results.And finally, you save your model.You may find all or some of these machine learning terms confusing, but don’t worry,we will talk about all of these topics in the following videos.The most important point to remember is that the entire process of a Machine Learning task can be done simply in a few lines of code, using scikit learn.Please notice that, though it is possible, it would not be that easy if you want to do all of this using Numpy or Scipy packages.And of course, it needs much more coding if you use pure python programming to implement all of these tasks.

 ##### Supervised vs Unsupervised
 we’ll introduce supervised algorithms versus unsupervised algorithms.An easy way to begin grasping the concept of supervised learning is by looking directly at the words that make it up.Supervise means to observe and direct the execution of a task, project, or activity.Obviously, we aren’t going to be supervising a person… Instead, ***we’ll be supervising a machine learning model that might be able to produce classification regions like we see here***.So, ***how do we supervise a machine learning model?*** We do this ***by “teaching” the model***.That is, we load the model with knowledge so that we can have it predict future instances.But … this leads to the next question, which is, ***“How exactly do we teach a model?”***We teach the model by training it with some data from a labeled dataset.It’s important to note that the data is labeled.And what does a labeled dataset look like? Well, it can look something like this.This example is taken from the cancer dataset.As you can see, we have some historical data for patients, and we already know the class of each row.Let’s start by introducing some components of this table.The names up here, which are called Clump thickness, Uniformity of cell size, Uniformity of cell shape, Marginal adhesion, and so on, are called Attributes.The columns are called Features, which include the data.If you plot this data, and look at a single data point on a plot, it’ll have all of these attributes.That would make a row on this chart, also referred to as an observation.Looking directly at the value of the data, you can have two kinds.The first is numerical. When dealing with machine learning, the most commonly used data is numeric.The second is categorical… that is, it’s non-numeric, because it contains characters rather than numbers. In this case, it’s categorical because this dataset is made for Classification.There are two types of Supervised Learning techniques.They are: ***classification and regression***.***Classification is the process of predicting a discrete class label or category.Regression is the process of predicting a continuous value as opposed to predicting a categorical value in Classification***.Look at this dataset.It is related to Co2 emissions of different cars.It includes Engine size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption and Co2 emission of various models of automobiles.Given this dataset, you can use regression to predict the Co2 emission of a new car by using other fields, such as Engine size or number of Cylinders.Since we know the meaning of supervised learning,what do you think unsupervised learning means?Unsupervised Learning is exactly as it sounds.We do not supervise the model, but we let the model work on its own to discover information that may not be visible to the human eye.It means, The Unsupervised algorithm trains on the dataset, and draws conclusions on UNLABELED data.Generally speaking, unsupervised learning has more difficult algorithms than supervised learning, since we know little to no information about the data, or the outcomes that are to be expected.***Dimension reduction, Density estimation, Market basket analysis and Clustering are the most widely used unsupervised machine learning techniques***.***Dimensionality Reduction and/or feature selection*** play a large role in this by reducing redundant features to make the classification easier.***Market basket analysis*** is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you’re more likely to buy another group of items.***Density estimation*** is a very simple concept that is mostly used to explore the data to find some structure within it.And finally, ***clustering***.**Clustering is considered to be one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning techniques used for grouping data points or objects that are somehow similar.Cluster analysis has many applications in different domains, whether it be a bank’s desire to segment its customers based on certain characteristics, or helping an individual to organize and group his/her favourite types of music! Generally speaking, though, Clustering is used mostly for: Discovering structure, Summarization, and Anomaly detection**. So, to recap, ***the biggest difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning is that supervised learning deals with labeled data while Unsupervised Learning deals with unlabeled data.*** In **supervised learning, we have machine learning algorithms for Classification and Regression**. In **unsupervised learning, we have methods such as clustering. In comparison to supervised learning, unsupervised learning has fewer models and fewer evaluation methods that can be used to ensure that the outcome of the model is accurate**.As such, unsupervised learning creates a less controllable environment, as the machine is creating outcomes for us.

#### Intro to Regression
we’ll be giving a brief introduction to regression.Look at this dataset.It's related to Co2 emissions from different cars.It includes Engine size, number of Cylinders, Fuel Consumption and Co2 emission from various automobile models.The question is, "Given this dataset, can we predict the Co2 emission of a car using other fields, such as EngineSize or Cylinders?"Let’s assume we have some historical data from different cars, and assume that a car,such as in row 9, has not been manufactured yet, but we're interested in estimating its approximate Co2 emission, after production.Is it possible?***We can use regression methods to predict a continuous value, such as CO2 Emission, using some other variables.Indeed, regression is the process of predicting a continuous value***.In ***regression there are two types of variables: a dependent variable and one or more independent variables***.The dependent variable can be seen as the "state", "target" or "final goal" we study and try to predict, and the independent variables, also known as explanatory variables, can be seen as the "causes" of those "states". The independent variables are shown conventionally by x; and the dependent variable is notated by y.A regression model relates y, or the dependent variable, to a function of x, i.e., the independent variables.The key point in the regression is that our dependent value should be continuous, and cannot be a discreet value.However, ***the independent variable or variables can be measured on either a categorical or continuous measurement scale***.So, what we want to do here is to use the historical data of some cars, ***using one or more of their features, and from that data, make a model.We use regression to build such a regression/estimation model***.Then the model is used to predict the expected Co2 emission for a new or unknown car.Basically there are ***2 types of regression models: simple regression and multiple regression***. ***Simple regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable.It can be either linear on non-linear.***For example, predicting Co2emission using the variable of EngineSize.***Linearity of regression is based on the nature of relationship between independent and dependent variables.When more than one independent variable is present, the process is called multiple linear regression***.For example, predicting Co2emission using EngineSize and the number of Cylinders in any given car.Again, ***depending on the relation between dependent and independent variables***, it can be ***either linear or non-linear regression***.Let’s examine some sample applications of regression.Essentially, we use regression when we want to estimate a continuous value. For instance, one of the applications of regression analysis could be in the area of sales forecasting.You can try to predict a salesperson's total yearly sales from independent variables such as age, education, and years of experience.It can also be used in the field of psychology, for example, to determine individual satisfaction based on demographic and psychological factors.We can use regression analysis to predict the price of a house in an area, based on its size, number of bedrooms, and so on.We can even use it to predict employment income for independent variables, such as hours of work, education, occupation, sex, age, years of experience, and so on.Indeed, you can find many examples of the usefulness of regression analysis in these and many other fields or domains, such as finance, healthcare, retail, and more.We have many regression algorithms.Each of them has its own importance and a specific condition to which their application is best suited.And while we've covered just a few of them in this course, it gives you enough base knowledge for you to explore different regression techniques.

#### Simple Linear Regression
we’ll be covering linear regression.You don’t need to know any linear algebra to understand topics in linear regression.This high-level introduction will give you enough background information on linear regression to be able to use it effectively on your own problems.Let’s take a look at this dataset. It’s related to the Co2 emission of different cars. It includes Engine size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption and Co2 emissions for various car models. The question is: Given this dataset, can we predict the Co2 emission of a car, using another field, such as Engine size? Quite simply, yes! ***We can use linear regression to predict a continuous value*** such as Co2 Emission, by using other variables.Linear regression is the approximation of a linear model used to describe the relationship between two or more variables. In simple linear regression, there are two variables: a dependent variable and an independent variable.The key point in the linear regression is that our dependent value should be continuous and cannot be a discreet value. However, the independent variable(s) can be measured on either a categorical or continuous measurement scale.There are ***two types of linear regression models***. They are: ***simple regression and multiple regression***.***Simple linear regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable***. For example, predicting **Co2 emission** using the **EngineSize** variable. ***When more than one independent variable is present, the process is called multiple linear regression***.For example, predicting **Co2 emission** using **EngineSize** and **Cylinders** of cars.Our focus in this video is on simple linear regression.Now, let’s see how linear regression works. OK, so let’s look at our dataset again.To understand linear regression, we can plot our variables here.We show Engine size as an independent variable, and Emission as the target value that we would like to predict. A scatterplot clearly shows the relation between variables where changes in one variable "explain" or possibly "cause" changes in the other variable.Also, it indicates that these variables are linearly related. With linear regression you can fit a line through the data.For instance, as the EngineSize increases, so do the emissions.With linear regression, you can model the relationship of these variables.A good model can be used to predict what the approximate emission of each car is.How do we use this line for prediction now? Let us assume, for a moment, that the line is a good fit of data. We can use it to predict the emission of an unknown car. For example, for a sample car, with engine size 2.4, you can find the emission is 214.Now, let’s talk about what this fitting line actually is.We’re going to predict **the target value, y.**In our case, using the independent variable, **"Engine Size," represented by x1.**The fit line is shown traditionally as a polynomial. In a simple regression problem (a single x),the form of the model would be θ0 +θ1 x1. In this equation, y ̂ is the dependent variable or the predicted value, and **x1 is the independent variable**; **θ0 and θ1 are the parameters** of the line that we must adjust. **θ1 is known as the "slope" or "gradient"of the fitting line and θ0 is known as the "intercept."θ0 and θ1 are also called the coefficients of the linear equation.**You can interpret this equation as y ̂ being a function of x1, or y ̂ being dependent of x1.Now the questions are: "How would you draw a line through the points?" And, "How do you determine which line ‘fitsbest’?"**Linear regression estimates the coefficients of the line**.This means we must calculate θ0 and θ1 to find the best line to ‘fit’ the data.This line would best estimate the emission of the unknown data points.Let’s see how we can find this line, or to be more precise, how we can adjust the parameters to make the line the best fit for the data.For a moment, let’s assume we’ve already found the best fit line for our data.Now, let’s go through all the points and check how well they align with this line.Best fit, here, means that if we have, for instance, a car with engine size x1=5.4, and actual Co2=250, its Co2 should be predicted very close to the actual value, which is y=250,based on historical data.But, if we use the fit line, or better to say, using our polynomial with known parameters to predict the Co2 emission, it will return y ̂ =340.Now, if you compare the actual value of the emission of the car with what we predicted using our model, you will find out that we have a 90-unit error.This means our prediction line is not accurate. This error is also called the residual error.So, we can say the error is the distance from the data point to the fitted regression line.The mean of all residual errors shows how poorly the line fits with the whole dataset.Mathematically, it can be shown by the equation, mean squared error, shown as (MSE).Our objective is to find a line where the mean of all these errors is minimized.In other words, the mean error of the prediction using the fit line should be minimized.Let’s re-word it more technically. ***The objective of linear regression is to minimize this MSE equation, and to minimize it, we should find the best parameters, θ0 and θ1***.Now, the question is, how to find θ0 and θ1 in such a way that it minimizes this error? How can we find such a perfect line? Or, said another way, how should we find the best parameters for our line? Should we move the line a lot randomly and calculate the MSE value every time, and choose the minimum one?Not really! Actually, we have two options here: Option 1 - We can use a mathematic approach. Or, Option 2 - We can use an optimization approach.Let’s see how we can easily use a mathematic formula to find the θ0 and θ1. As mentioned before, θ0 and θ1, in the simple linear regression, are the coefficients of the fit line. We can use a simple equation to estimate these coefficients. That is, given that it’s a simple linear regression, with only 2 parameters, and knowing that θ0 and θ1 are the intercept and slopeof the line, we can estimate them directly from our data.It requires that we calculate the mean of the independent and dependent or target columns,from the dataset. Notice that all of the data must be available to traverse and calculate the parameters. It can be shown that the intercept and slope can be calculated using these equations. We can start off by estimating the value for θ1.This is how you can find the slope of a line based on the data. x ̅  is the average value for the engine size in our dataset. Please consider that we have 9 rows here,row 0 to 8. First, we calculate the average of x1 and average of y. Then we plug it into the slope equation, to find θ1. The xi and yi in the equation refer to the fact that we need to repeat these calculations across all values in our dataset and i refers to the i’th value of x or y.Applying all values, we find θ1=39; it is our second parameter. It is used to calculate the first parameter, which is the intercept of the line.Now, we can plug θ1 into the line equation to find θ0.It is easily calculated that θ0=125.74. So, these are the two parameters for the line,where θ0 is also called the bias coefficient and θ1 is the coefficient for the Co2 Emission column. As a side note, you really don’t need to remember the formula for calculating these parameters, as most of the libraries used for machine learning in Python, R, and Scala can easily find these parameters for you.But it’s always good to understand how it works.Now, we can write down the polynomial of the line.So, we know how to find the best fit for our data, and its equation.Now the question is: "How can we use it to predict the emission of a new car based on its engine size?"After we found the parameters of the linear equation, making predictions is as simple as solving the equation for a specific set of inputs.Imagine we are predicting Co2 Emission(y) from EngineSize(x) for the Automobile in record number 9. Our linear regression model representation for this problem would be: y ̂ = θ0 + θ1 x1. Or if we map it to our dataset, it would be Co2Emission = θ0 + θ1 EngineSize.As we saw, we can find θ0, θ1 using the equations that we just talked about.Once found, we can plug in the equation of the linear model.For example, let’s use θ0=125 and θ1=39. So, we can rewrite the linear model as 𝐶𝑜2𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛=125+39𝐸𝑛𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒.Now, let’s plug in the 9th row of our dataset and calculate the Co2 Emission for a car with an EngineSize of 2.4. So Co2Emission = 125 + 39 × 2.4.Therefore, we can predict that the Co2 Emission for this specific car would be 218.6.Let’s talk a bit about why Linear Regression is so useful.Quite simply, it is the most basic regression to use and understand.In fact, one reason why Linear Regression is so useful is that it’s fast!It also doesn’t require tuning of parameters. So, something like tuning the K parameterin K-Nearest Neighbors or the learning rate in Neural Networks isn’t something to worry about. Linear Regression is also easy to understand and highly interpretable.

#### Multiple Linear Regression
we’ll be covering multiple linear regression.
As you know **there are two types of linear regression models: simple regression and multiple regression**. <font color=red>Simple linear regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable.</font> For example, predicting Co2 emission using the variable of EngineSize. In reality, there are multiple variables that predict the Co2 emission. **When multiple independent variables are present,the process is called multiple linear regression.** For example, predicting Co2 emission using EngineSize and the number of Cylinders in the car’s engine.Our focus in this video is on multiple linear regression.The good thing is that multiple linear regression is the extension of the simple linear regression model. So, I suggest you go through the Simple Linear Regression video first, if you haven’t watched it already.Before we dive into a sample dataset and see how multiple linear regression works, I want to tell you what kind of problems it can solve; when we should use it; and, specifically,what kind of questions we can answer using it.Basically, there are two applications for multiple linear regression.First, it can be used when we would like to identify the strength of the effect that the independent variables have on a dependent variable.For example, does revision time, test anxiety, lecture attendance, and gender, have any effect on exam performance of students? 
<font color=red>SSecond, it can be used to predict the impact of changes.</font> That is, to understand how the dependent variable changes when we change the independent variables. For example, if we were reviewing a person’s health data, a multiple linear regression can tell you how much that person’s blood pressure goes up (or down) for every unit increase (or decrease) in a patient’s body mass index (BMI), holding other factors constant.As is the case with simple linear regression, multiple linear regression is a method of predicting a continuous variable. It uses multiple variables, called independent variables, or predictors, that best predict the value of the target variable, which is also called the dependent variable. In multiple linear regression, the target value, y, is a linear combination of independent variables, x.For example, you can predict how much Co2 a car might emit due to independent variables,such as the car’s Engine Size, Number of Cylinders and Fuel Consumption.Multiple linear regression is very useful because you can examine which variables are significant predictors of the outcome variable. Also, you can find out how each feature impacts the outcome variable. And again, as is the case in simple linearregression, if you manage to build such a regression model, you can use it to predict the emission amount of an unknown case, such as record number 9.Generally, the model is of the form: y ̂=θ_0+ θ_1 x_1+ θ_2 x_2 and so on, up to ... +θ_n x_n. Mathematically, we can show it as a vector form as well.This means, it can be shown as a dot product of 2 vectors: the parameters vector and the feature set vector.Generally, we can show the equation for a multi-dimensional space as θ^T x, where θ is an n-by-one vector of unknown parameters in a multi-dimensional space, and x is the vector of the feature sets, as θ is a vector of coefficients, and is supposed to be multiplied by x. Conventionally, it is shown as transpose θ.θ is also called the parameters, or, weight vector of the regression equation … both these terms can be used interchangeably. And x is the feature set, which represents a car. For example x1 for engine size, or x2 for cylinders, and so on.The first element of the feature set would be set to 1, because it turns the θ_0 into the intercept or bias parameter when the vector is multiplied by the parameter vector.Please notice that θ^T x in a one dimensional space, is the equation of a line.It is what we use in simple linear regression. In higher dimensions, when we have more than one input (or x), the line is called a plane or a hyper-plane.And this is what we use for multiple linear regression.So, the whole idea is to find the best fit hyper-plane for our data.To this end, and as is the case in linear regression, we should estimate the values for θ vector that best predict the value of the target field in each row.To achieve this goal, we have to minimize the error of the prediction.Now, the question is, "How do we find the optimized parameters?"To find the optimized parameters for our model, we should first understand what the optimized parameters are. Then we will find a way to optimize the parameters.In short, optimized parameters are the ones which lead to a model with the fewest errors.Let’s assume, for a moment, that we have already found the parameter vector of our model. It means we already know the values of θ vector. Now, we can use the model, and the feature set of the first row of our dataset to predict the Co2 emission for the first car, correct?If we plug the feature set values into the model equation, we find y ̂ .Let’s say, for example, it returns 140 as the predicted value for this specific row.What is the actual value? y=196. How different is the predicted value from the actual value of 196? Well, we can calculate it quite simply, as 196-140, which of course = 56. This is the error of our model, only for one row, or one car, in our case. As is the case in linear regression, we can say the error here is the distance from the data point to the fitted regression model.The mean of all residual errors shows how bad the model is representing the dataset.It is called the mean squared error, or MSE.Mathematically, MSE can be shown by an equation. While this is not the only way to expose the error of a multiple linear regression model, it is one the most popular ways to do so.The best model for our dataset is the one with minimum error for all prediction values.So, the objective of multiple linear regression is to minimize the MSE equation.To minimize it, we should find the best parameters θ, but how?Okay, “How do we find the parameter or coefficients for multiple linear regression?”There are many ways to estimate the value of these coefficients.However, the most common methods are the ordinary least squares and optimization approach.Ordinary least squares tries to estimate the values of the coefficients by minimizing the “Mean Square Error.” This approach uses the data as a matrix and uses linear algebra operations to estimate the optimal values for the theta. The problem with this technique is the time complexity of calculating matrix operations, as it can take a very long time to finish. When the number of rows in your dataset is less 10,000 you can think of this technique as an option, however, for greater values,you should try other faster approaches.The second option is to use an optimization algorithm to find the best parameters.That is, you can use a process of optimizing the values of the coefficients by iteratively minimizing the error of the model on your training data. For example, you can use Gradient Descent, which starts optimization with random values for each coefficient. Then, calculates the errors, and tries to minimize it through wise changing of the coefficients in multiple iterations. Gradient descent is a proper approach if you have a large dataset.Please understand, however, that there are other approaches to estimate the parameters of the multiple linear regression that you can explore on your own. After you find the best parameters for your model, you can go to the prediction phase.After we found the parameters of the linear equation, making predictions is as simple as solving the equation for a specific set of inputs.Imagine we are predicting Co2 emission (or y) from other variables for the automobile in record number 9. Our linear regression model representationfor this problem would be: y ̂=θ^T x. Once we find the parameters, we can plug them into the equation of the linear model. For example, let’s use θ0 = 125, θ1 = 6.2,θ2 = 14, and so on. If we map it to our dataset, we can rewrite the linear model as "Co2Emission=125 plus 6.2 multiplied by EngineSize plus 14 multiplied by Cylinder," and so on. As you can see, multiple linear regression estimates the relative importance of predictors. For example, it shows Cylinder has higher impact on Co2 emission amounts in comparison with EngineSize.Now, let’s plug in the 9th row of our dataset and calculate the Co2 emission for a car with the EngineSize of 2.4. So Co2Emission=125 + 6.2 × 2.4 + 14 × 4… and so on. We can predict the Co2 emission for this specific car would be 214.1. Now let me address some concerns that you might already be having regarding multiple linear regression. As you saw, you can use multiple independent variables to predict a target value in multiple linear regression.It sometimes results in a better model compared to using a simple linear regression, which uses only one independent variable to predict the dependent variable.Now, the question is, "How many independent variables should we use for the prediction?"Should we use all the fields in our dataset? Does adding independent variables to a multiple linear regression model always increase the accuracy of the model? Basically, adding too many independent variables without any theoretical justification may result in an over-fit model. An over-fit model is a real problem becauseit is too complicated for your data set and not general enough to be used for prediction.So, it is recommended to avoid using many variables for prediction.There are different ways to avoid overfitting a model in regression, however, that is outside the scope of this video.The next question is, “Should independent variables be continuous?”Basically, categorical independent variables can be incorporated into a regression model by converting them into numerical variables. For example, given a binary variable such as car type, the code dummies “0” for “Manual” and 1 for “automatic” cars.As a last point, remember that “multiple linear regression” is a specific type of linear regression. So, there needs to be a linear relationship between the dependent variable and each of your independent variables.There are a number of ways to check for linear relationship.For example, you can use scatterplots, and then visually check for linearity.If the relationship displayed in your scatterplot is not linear, then, you need to use non-linear regression.
